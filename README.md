# SFML Test Project
This project is an experiment using C++ and SFML 2.4.2 (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library).

## What does it do?
As of January 8th, 2018, you can move a coloured box around a black background using W-A-S-D! Wow!

## Running the Project
The .dll files for the project are for running on a Windows 64-bit machine. To get the proper .dll files for your computer, you can go to https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php to download SFML 2.4.2 and then follow the tutorial to use CMake to build your libraries. Then, replace the .dll (and .a) files in the project with the ones you've generated.

After you have the proper .dll files, you can run the `make` command for your machine to build the executable.
